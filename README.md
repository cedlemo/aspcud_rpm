# Aspcud package for opam on fedora 27

## Context

opam need [aspcud](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Specifying_Solver_Preferences.html)
as a dependency and there is no package for rpm linux distribution.
The idea is to try to create packages for the dependencies and eventually
create a rpm for opam.

### For package that need cmake to be build:

the needed package are `cmake` and `cmake-rpm-macros`, the following instruction
is sufficient:

    BuildRequires: cmake

mock will install in its chroot cmake and cmake-rpm-macros as dependency.

### Build a src rpm from a spec file:

```bash
spectool -g clasp.spec
# download the package listed as source0
fedpkg --release f27 mockbuild
# build both the src rpm and the rpm
```

### Add local rpm to mock repository.
